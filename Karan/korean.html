<ol>
<li>Kimchi Pancake</li>
<img src="kimchijeon.jpg" alt="Kimchi Pancake" width="205.714" height="288"><br>

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>
<ul>
<li>1 cup kimchi, drained of excess liquid and chopped into bite-sized pieces</li>  
<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/4 cup water</li>
<li>1 egg, beaten with a fork</li>
<li>1 green onion, trimmed and thinly sliced on the diagonal</li>
<li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, water, beaten egg, chopped kimchi and sliced green onions vigorously until a smooth, lump-free batter forms.</li>
<li>Heat 1-2 Tbsp vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet or pan over medium heat. Swirl to coat the bottom.</li>  
<li>Scoop about 3 Tbsp of batter per pancake into the hot oil. Gently flatten and shape each pancake into a circle with the back of a spoon.</li> 
<li>Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown. Flip carefully with a spatula.</li>
<li>Transfer cooked pancakes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
<li>Serve the hot kimchi pancakes immediately, garnished with extra sliced green onions if desired.</li>
</ul>

<li>Mandu (Korean Dumplings)</li>
<img src="mandu.jpg" alt="Mandu" width="250" height="166.66"><br>

<strong>Ingredients:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>1/2 lb ground pork</li>
<li>1/2 lb ground beef</li> 
<li>3 green onions, trimmed and finely minced</li>
<li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
<li>30 small round wonton wrappers</li>
</ul>

<strong>Steps:</strong>
<ul>  
<li>In a large bowl, thoroughly mix together the ground pork, ground beef, minced green onions, soy sauce and sesame oil using your hands until well combined.</li>
<li>Place a wonton wrapper diagonally on a clean, dry work surface. Scoop approximately 1 tbsp of filling into the center.</li>
<li>Use your finger to brush the edges of the wrapper lightly with water. Fold the wrapper in half to form a triangle, pressing firmly along the edges to seal tightly.</li>
<li>Place the filled mandu on a baking sheet lightly dusted with flour, seam side up. This prevents sticking.</li> 
<li>Steam the mandu in a single layer in a bamboo steamer lined with parchment for 12-15 minutes until filling is cooked through.</li>  
</ul>
</ol>
